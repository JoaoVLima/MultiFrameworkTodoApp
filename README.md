# 🧰 Multi-Framework Todo App
Multi-framework exploration: Building a Todo app in Java (Spring Boot), PHP (Laravel), Ruby (Ruby on Rails), Haskell (Scotty), and C# (ASP.NET) to compare approaches, strengths, and trade-offs.

This repository is the **main hub** for a project that implements the same simple **Todo List application** across multiple programming languages and web frameworks.

The goal is to **explore and compare** how different ecosystems approach web development:

* Boilerplate vs. convention
* Developer experience
* Type safety vs. flexibility
* Best use cases for each

---

## 📝 The Todo App

The app is intentionally minimal, featuring:

* Create a todo
* List todos
* View a single todo
* Update a todo
* Delete a todo

Each framework implements the same features so that the focus is on **differences in the frameworks themselves**, not the app’s complexity.

---

## 🚀 Implementations

🔗 Here are the framework-specific repositories:

* [Java (Spring Boot)]() *(upcoming)*
* [PHP (Laravel)]() *(upcoming)*
* [Ruby (Rails)]() *(upcoming)*
* [Haskell (Scotty)]() *(upcoming)*
* [C# (.NET)]() *(upcoming)*

## 🎯 Purpose

By building the same app in multiple frameworks, we’ll compare:

* **Ease of setup**
* **Code structure and conventions**
* **Learning curve**
* **Strengths and trade-offs**
* **Ideal use cases**

This is a **learning project**, not intended for production.
